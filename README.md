# CouponsAccepted
The problem addressed in this report is identifying what driving scenarios and characteristics would lead to a higher acceptance rate for coupons that are aimed to entice drivers to visit one of five establishments: Coffee Houses, Bars, Carry Out, Cheap Restuarants, and More Expensive Restaurants.

The data analyzed in ths exercised was a csv file comprised of 26 columns with one column representing a "Yes/No" on whether a driver would accept a coupon. The other columns were various driver demographics (age, gender, occupation), driving scenarios (time of day, passengers), and driver behavioral data (amount of times a driver frequented an establishment).
